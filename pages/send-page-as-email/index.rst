Send page as e-mail
=============================================

**Work on this page has just started. Will be finished soon.**

If you should need it, you can send a page through e-mail. To be able to do so the following must have been done:

+ The option "Enable Send as E-mail" must be activated in the page collection settings.
+ E-mail recipients must have been added for the page(s) you would like to send.

Every time you publish such a page you will be able to send the page if you want, or just publish without sending.
