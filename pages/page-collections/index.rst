Page Collections
==================

Within a Publishing App a number of Page Collections can exist, where some settings can differ, for example if approval of new pages are needed or not. 

A Page Collection contains, as the name imply, a number of pages.

If the Feature “Default Page Collections and Page Types” has been activated, two Page Collections has been created; Start and News. If needed, additional Page Collections can be created within the Publishing App.
