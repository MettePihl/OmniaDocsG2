Using Omnia Feed
===================

With Omnia Feed users can stay connected to the organization's Omnia Intranet wherever they are. 

Omnia Feed can be set up in many different ways to make it possible for users to read information from their organization's intranet, on their mobile device. A good example is News, but it can be any page(s) really, and anything that can be accessed by a link. 

Here's an example:

Any number of tabs can be set up for access to different resources. A tab can be set up for:

+ A Rollup (similar to a Page Rollup) to list news or other pages. Sign-off requests can shown here as well.
+ An Embedded link, which can be used to show the home page of an Omnia intranet, or to show some specific Omnia functionality - for example My Links or My Tasks.
+ An External link, which for example can be used as a shortcut to other applications (time report, HR system, etc).

Settings are found in Omnia Admin. There are settings for the tenant, mainly used by AM and the Omnia Feed Team to set up the tenant, and then settings for each Business Profile, where for example the tabs are set up. See this page for more information: :doc:`Omnia Feed - Business Profile Settings </admin-settings/business-group-settings/omnia-feed/index>`

For an implementation example, see this page: :doc:`Omnia Feed - implementation example </using-omnia-feed/omnia-feed-implemenation-example/index>`

Microsoft Authenticator or similar
---------------------------------------------
If your organization is using Microsoft Authenticator, a Company Portal, or similar, Omnia Feed will request permission to access the contacts list. This is required for the Omnia app to work with Microsoft Authenticator and similar solutions.

Important note about logged in status
--------------------------------------
If the user chooses to log out, the user will no longer receive push notificatons until logged in again.

If the user is being logged out automically due to an organization policy or similar, the user still receives push notifications for three weeks. After that, the user must log in to continue receiving push notifications.
