Working with controlled documents in a publishing app
========================================================

It's possible to work with controlled documents in a Publishing app. This is what is needed:

+ A publishing layout for this purpose.
+ Document picker categories set upp correctly.
+ Document Management settings set up in the publishing app settings.
+ A menu option for controlled documents in the page menu (publishing app settings).

For more information see:

+ :doc:`Publishing Layouts </admin-settings/business-group-settings/publishing-apps/publishing-65/layout/index>`
+ :doc:`Document Picker settings </admin-settings/business-group-settings/settings/document-picker/index>`
+ :doc:`Publishing App settings </pages/page-settings/publishing-app-settings-612/index>`

Here's an example with a layout for controlled documents:

You use it the same way as is described for Controlled Documents.
