Process Tasks block
=======================

Use this block to display the To Do-list the process author added (on the Tasks tab) for the process. Note that this is is not Sharepoint tasks, just a To Do-list.

You can add a title for the block and add some padding, if needed.

Layout and Write
*********************
The WRITE Tab is not used here. The LAYOUT tab contains general settings, see: :doc:`General Block Settings </blocks/general-block-settings/index>`
