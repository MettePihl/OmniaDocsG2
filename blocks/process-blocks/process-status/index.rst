Process status block
=======================================

This block can be used in a process context to set and view the status for a step in the process. Mainly for use in Teams.

Here's an user example. The user selcts a process step and can then see or edit the status for that step.

As an administrator you place the block when creating/editing a layout for a process page.

There are no specific settings for the block, only the general block settings found under LAYOUT. See this page for more information: :doc:`General block settings </blocks/general-block-settings/index>`
