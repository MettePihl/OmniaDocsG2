When the option is selected, you can enter a number indicating the priority for duplicates, for this block. If you set "1" for a block it means this block has priority showing a post that would have been a duplicate. 
+ **Navigation Depth Level**: Available for scope Navigation path. Choose the number of nodes that should be displayed, including the start node.
+ **Page Size**: Use the slider, or type the number (1-99) to set the number of items (pages) that should be displayed on each "page" of the list. Also see under *Display* below for additional settings for the list. 
+ **Query Item Limit**: Use the slider, or type the number (1-99) to set the number of pages that should be retrieved to make sure all duplicates are found. You should not set this number higher than you really need, as higher numbers may have an impact on performance. Note that when you change the number, "Max Display Limit" is also changed, see below.

More on Scope Navigation Path
---------------------------------
Navigation path is a special case, it's used for creating a navigation. When you have selected start node you can choose start node and navigation depth. There's also a view available, specifically for Navigation Path; Navigation View. Select it under Display. It's only available if you first select Navigation Path as Scope.

**A tip**: When you're creating a Page Type, selecting Current Node for a Navigation Path can be very useful. Wherever that Page Type is used, the view (Navigation View) always starts at the current node for that page.
