+ **Show Search Box**: To add a search box, select this option. You can do that without selecting any other options.
+ **Add filter**: To add filters, click this link. See below for more information.
+ **Save filter state**:  If you select this option the filter keeps it’s state in the page url as long as the page is active, and will be activated when the user goes back to the page, by using the browser’s Back button. The url can also be copied and for example be used to prepopulate the rollup.
+ **Run query on load**: Decide if the query should be run on load, so the list is filled with when the user enters the page, or not. If there are a lot of requests, an effective solution could be to show a search box and not use this option.
+ **Show selected values area**: (A description will be added soon).
+ **Fixed filter area**: (A description will be added soon).
+ **Dialog position**: You can choose to place the dialog Left or Right.

+ **Only search when using filter**: If you select this option the list is empty when the user enters the page. The user must choose a filter for the search to be executed.
+ **Hide filter by default**: If you chose a search box you can select this option. Then no filters are shown until users has executed a search and got a search result.
