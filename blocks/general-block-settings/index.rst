General Block Settings
===========================================

The Layout tab contains settings that are general for most blocks, but scoped for each block. 

Adding filters to a block, if it's possible, works the same for most blocks. Find a general description of how to do that here:

For Omnia 6.13 and earlier :doc:`Filter UI </blocks/general-block-settings/filters/index>`

For Omnia 7.0 and later :doc:`Filter options for blocks in Omnia 7.0 </blocks/general-block-settings/filter-options-block/index>`

The Layout tab contain the following settings:

The available themes are listed, for example:

The themes are set up for the Business Profile in Omnia Admin, see: :doc:`Theme </admin-settings/business-group-settings/settings/theme/index>`

When you have chosen a theme you can edit colors for background, foreground and text, if needed. Note that the theme and colors you chose are shown in the block for a preview.

When you select Show Advanced Settings, the following settings becomes available:

.. image:: block-theming-advanced-new.png

You can try out these settings for various effects. You can see a preview in the block.

Header
*********
The follwowing is available for header settings:

.. image:: layout-header-new3.png

+ **Anchor Name**: You can set an anchor name for this block. When a block has an anchor name, you can link to the block, using a the Add Link block or using an Action Button.
+ **Icon Type**: If you would like an icon to be shown for the block, the first step is to select icon type. (If you don't select an icon, Icon Type has no effect).
+ **Icon**: After having selected icon type, then select the icon.
+ **Custom settings**: For Header you can choose to use the global settings (set up in Omnia Admin) or use Custom Settings for this block.

Available custom settings for TEXT:

.. image:: layout-header-custom-new2.png

You can set these custom settings, for STYLE:

.. image:: layout-header-custom-style.png

+ **Follow Theming**: Select this to follow the theming you selected under Theming. If you don't you can select a custom background color.

The rest of the options should be self explanatory.

And these settings are available for ICON:

.. image:: layout-header-custom-icon.png

You can just try out different settings and see the effect in the block.

Targeting
************
A lot of blocks can be targeted to one or more groups using Targeting Properties. 

To target a block, open the settings for the block and select "Add Targeting Filter".

You set up targeting for a block, if available, the same way as in many other parts of Omnia. See this page for more information: :doc:`Using Targeting </general-assets/targeting-in-omnia/index>`

***********
For some blocks you can use Custom CSS settings. You then use this option:
