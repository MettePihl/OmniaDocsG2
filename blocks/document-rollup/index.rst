See this page for more information on how to use the Document Picker: :doc:`The Document Picker </general-assets//document-picker/index>`

Query Builder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Here you add queries, which is the detailed "settings" for what to display in the list:

1. Set scope for the document rollup: 

.. image:: document-rollup-settings-query-scope-new2.png

+ **All Documents** - always available, meaning ALL documents the logged in user has permissions to read. Use the query settings below to limit what will be shown in the rollup. The rollup can then be set to display just "normal" documents or both normal and controlled documents. To rollup documents from one or more Team Sites, use this option.
+ **Published Documents**  - available only if Controlled Documents is active. Meaning ALL published CONTROLLED DOCUMENTS the logged in user has permissions to read. Use the query settings below to limit what will be shown in the rollup.
+ **Archived Documents** - available only if Controlled Documents is active. Meaning all published Controlled Documents in the Archive. As permissions to read documents in the Archive normally is given to just a few, this is for specialized implementations.

**Note!** Regardless of what you select here, the documents that will be displayed for a user are only those documents that the user has premissions to read.

2. Use the three lists for base settings and the field to add a Query Parameter.

3. Click "Add" to add the Query. 

Note that you can type the script directly in the field, if you know how. You can use all options in the Keyword Query Language (KQL). See this Microsoft page for reference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/general-development/keyword-query-language-kql-syntax-reference

Additionally you can set:

+ **Last modified by current user**: Use this option to limit the rollup to documents the logged in user has edited, for example for a "My Latest Documents" implementation.
