Sign-off Requests Rollup
==========================

This block is used for listing the Sign-off Requests that is sent to the logged in user or a group that the user belongs to.

This page describes how this works in Omnia 6.12 and earlier. For information on this block in Omnia 6.13, see: :doc:`Sign-off Requests Rollup in Omnia 613 </blocks/sign-off-requests-rollup-613/index>`

Here's an example with one of the requests opened:

.. image:: sign-off-request-rollup-example.png

The user can read the information by clicking the link and can then sign off using the button:

.. image:: sign-off-request-rollup-example-signedoff.png

The colored dots indicates the progress: green for all read, yellow for some and white for none, within each request, and for the whole request.

It's also possible to "UNDO" a request, really meaning reading the information again.

**********
In the settings for the block, you can just add a block name:

Settings for Sign-off Requests are available in Tenant settings: :doc:`Settings for Sign-off Requests </admin-settings/tenant-settings/sign-off-requests/index>`
