Print proceses in Omnia 7.0
================================================

**This documentation is just started.**

To print a process, go to the process and click the button. This can be set up in several ways. Here's an example:

.. image:: print-process-button-new.png

You can choose the following:

.. image:: print-process-settings-new.png

+ **All related process steps**: This prints all related process steps, both main processes and subprocesses. If this process is linked to from a main process, that main process will not be printed.
+ **Single process step only**: Select this to just print the step you see.
+ **Language**: Here you can change the language to be printed BUT the process in question must have been translated to the language chosen to make any difference. If a translation for the chosen language does not exist, english will be the language printed.
+ **Include process drawing**: By default the process drawing (if any) will be printed. Deselect if you don't want that.

When you have chosen what to print, click PRINT PROCESS.
