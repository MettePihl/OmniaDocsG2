Authoring processes in Omnia 7.0
================================================

**This documentation is just started. Don't use yet**

This section is for Authors of processes. The work always take place in a Processes Library in a Team Site. Who is allowed to author and approve (if approval is needed) is set up in Omnia Admin under Process Management.

When a Team Site has been set up for process authoring, the following will be available for authors:

+ A Processes library that only users that has the right permissions can work with.
+ A Publish Workflow.
+ A Tasks list.
+ Process History for the published editions.
+ Options for relating to documents; controlled documents or "normal" documents.
+ Options for creating a new draft from a published process.
+ Options for unpublishing a process.

In a Team Site set up for process authoring, a library, usually called just "Processes", is available here:

In the Procsses library, authors can find three tabs:

"Drafts" is used when creating and editing drafts for new processes or when updating an existing process for a new edition. 

"Tasks" is a list of author tasks for the processes â€“ tasks you have assigned to colleagues or tasks assigned to you.

When a process is published (approved for publication) it is removed from "Drafts" and is available on the "Published" tab. Here the options for creating a new draft, unpublishing and process history are available, see: :doc:`Working with Published processes </working-with-processes/authoring-processes/working-with-published-processes/index>`.

Most headings can be used to sort a list.
