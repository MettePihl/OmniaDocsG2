When in Preview mode you can test how the process will look on different devices:

Important note about preview and different devices
---------------------------------------------------
Although you can select different devices in the preview, it's important to know that there's no scaling. The process canvas is always diplayed in 100%. The preview will show how much of the canvas that will be shown on different devices without scrolling.
