The same options are available when you edit a draft process as when creating one, see all options here: :doc:`Working with drafts </working-with-processes/authoring-processes/working-with-drafts/index>`

If the process is published you will have to create a new draft from the published edition, to be able to edit the process, see: :doc:`Create a new draft from a published process </working-with-processes/authoring-processes/working-with-drafts/new-draft-from-published/index>`
