Note that another way to add process steps is to work with the shapes, see: :doc:`The Drawing tab - authoring processes </working-with-processes/authoring-processes/working-with-drafts/drawing-tab/index>`

You can open the menu for a process step to create process steps under a process step, add linked processes to that process step, edit the title, move the process step or delete it.
