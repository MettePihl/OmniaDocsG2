Using the work space for processes in Omnia 7.0
================================================

**This documentation is just started.**

You use the tabs when working with the process or a process step:

All tabs are available for all process steps. Regarding Properties, you set them for the whole process.

Here's a short overview of what to use the tabs for:

+ **Drawing**: Here you work with the graphic presentation of the process, which can also serve as a navigation of the process. You can visualize the process and the process steps by adding shapes and/or upload an image and add clickable areas to that image.
+ **Content**: Use this tab to add a description of the process or process step. You can usually use both text and images to do that.
+ **Documents**: You use this tab create a list of documents relevant to the process or process step, documents that users can read.
+ **Pages**: You use this tab create a list of pages relevant to the process or process step, pages that users can read.
+ **Links**: Here you can add useful links for users, for the process or process step.
+ **Tasks**: Use this tab to work with a To Do-list for the process or process step. Note that this is not Sharepoint Tasks, just a To Do list.
+ **Properties**: You use this tab to set the properties for the process. Available for the main level, the process, only.

Design mode or Preview mode
****************************
You can use two different modes when working with a process; Design mode for editing the process or a process step, and Preview to see what it will look like for users. You switch between the modes here:
