Delete a draft process in Omnia 7.0
================================================

**This documentation is just started. Don't use yet.**

**Important!** When you delete a draft process there is no way of retrieving it, so make sure you delete the right process!

If you need to delete a draft process, do the following:

1. Select the process in the list.
2. Open the dot menu and select "Delete Draft".

Note that if the process has been published at least once, the last published edition is still available for users, and a new draft can, in that case, still be created from the Published tab.
