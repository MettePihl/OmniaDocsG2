+ **Pages**: You can select one publishing app to show metrics for. If you don't, metrics for all Publishing Apps will be shown. You can also select a specific page type or a combination of both.

Metrics
*********
The following settings are available here:

.. image:: metrics-block-settings-metrics.png

+ **Metrics per row**: Set the number of metrics to be shown per row.
+ **Metric block height**: Use the slider to set the height of the block.

In the field at the bottom you can select which metrics that should be shown, one or several. The options are different depending on the Scope chosen:

+ Teamwork: You can choose to show total number of teamworks, active teamworks, inactive or new teamworks. 
+ Search Statistics: You can select search statistics for the total number of queries, abandoned queries or no result queries.
+ Pages: Here's a lot of options available - Published, Waiting For Approval, Draft, No Comments, Average Number Of Comments, Average ratings, Reach and Underused Content. "No Comments" lists the number of pages that has no comment at all. "Average Number Of Comments" is calculated this way: Total number of comments on all pages dived by the total number of pages. So if there are a total of 100 comments on all pages and there are 200 pages, the average number of comments would be 0,5.
+ User Activity: You can select to show the number of active readers or the number of active contributors.

What is to be considered Underused Content can be set in Omnia Admin, see: :doc:`Metrics Settings </admin-settings/tenant-settings/settings/metrics/index>`
