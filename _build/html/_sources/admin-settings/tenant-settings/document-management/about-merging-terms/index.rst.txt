About merging terms
=============================================

If you merge terms that are used in document management, you need to be aware of this:

+ It can take several hours before the mereged terms are available for use in the lists for published and draft documents.
+ Before the merged terms are available, the old ones does not show any data/content.
+ In rollups the old terms are shown until a document is updated and republished.
