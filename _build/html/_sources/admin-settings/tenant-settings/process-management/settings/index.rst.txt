+ PDF Header; Contains settings for the header. You can use placeholders for dynamic information, see below.

Using placeholders
*********************
Placeholders are properties added between double brackets. When you print, the placeholders are replaced by by actual data, for example the title for the process or a date.

You can use these placeholders in the cover page, the header or the footer. Short information about them is available through the i icon.
