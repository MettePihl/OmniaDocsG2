Promoted Search Results
===========================

Based on search feedback, an administrator can create promoted search results in Omnia Admin.

Whenever a user searches on any of the keywords of a Promoted Search Result, it will be available here in Advanced Search:

Or here in Quick Search:

.. image:: promoted-search-results-quick-new.png

You decide to enable/disable promoted search results in the settings for Advanced Search and for Quick Search, respectively.

You create a list of promoted search result to be used for both Advanced Search and Quick Search. Here's an example:

.. image:: promoted-search-results-list-new.png

To edit, click the pen. To delete, click the dust bin.

When you edit a promoted search result, the same settings are available as when creating a new one, see below.
