Teamwork Navigation - additional settings
*******************************************
Click the cog wheel to set additional settings for Teamwork Navigation. Here's what you can set:

.. image:: teamwork-navigation-overview-new.png

You can edit which Categories (tabs) to display in Teamwork Navigation and you can work with a number of details for what is actually shown under each category. Using the option Create Teamwork you can edit the settings for what is to be displayed regarding Show Create New Site, and if that option should be available for users at all.

Note that a category is basically a Team Collaboration Rollup, so if you think along this line when you edit the settings for a category, you're on the right track.

Categories
------------
You can edit categories this way:

+ Click the dust bin to remove a category.
+ Click the cog wheel to handle the detailed settings for a category. 

When editing settings for a category, the same settings are available as when creating a new category, see below.

+ To add a new category, click ADD.

.. image:: teamwork-navigation-add-new.png

The following settings are available:

.. image:: teamwork-navigation-add-settings-new2.png

+ **Category Name**: Add a name for the category (tab) here, in some or all the available languages. Click the flag to change language.

General
----------
Here you can add a Block Title if needed. Click the flag to change language.

.. image:: teamwork-navigation-general-new.png

The Title is shown under the Categories.

Query
'''''''
For Query you can set:

.. image:: teamwork-navigation-addquery-new2.png

+ **Scope**: Select scope, for example All, Followed or Member of. (See more information about this below.).
+ **Only Current Business Profile**: Below you can select Business Profile to execute the query in. If you want to do that for the Current Business profile only, select this option.
+ **Business Profile**: You can select a Business Profile for the query in this list.
+ **Site Template**: Here you can select one or more Site Templates for the query, meaning all sites that are created from this template, in the selected Business Profile. Don't forget to click ADD when you have salected a Tamplate. It's not mandatory. If you don't select Site Templates here, the query is run for all sites.
+ **Run Query On Load**: For a shorter list of Teamworks, it most likely works fine to run a query when the list is opened, but for longer lists it may not. For a longer list, for example a list of all Teamworks, deselecting this option and instead displaying a search box, may be a better choice. 

To add a search box, use the Filter settings, see below.

Regarding Scope, hereâ€™s more detailed information:

Note that the first three scopes only include teamwork connected to Omnia that are assigned a provisioning template and can be found in the Teamwork list within Omnia admin.

+ All (public): All Teamwork App Instances where "Show in public listings" is checked. (Omnia Database).
+ Followed: All followed Teamwork App Instances. (Omnia Database).
+ Last Visited: All last visited Teamwork App Instances. (Omnia Database).
+ All (SharePoint Sites): All sites in SharePoint. (SharePoint Search).
+ Followed (SharePoint Sites): All followed sites in SharePoint. (SharePoint Social API).
+ Member of (Office 365 Groups): Member of Office 365 Groups. (MS Graph).
