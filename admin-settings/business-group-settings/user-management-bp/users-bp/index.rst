The options here works the same way as in User management for the tenant. There are only two major differences:

+ Users set up in a business profile has access to that business profile only.
+ The filter "Owner", available in the tenant list, is not available for a business profile.

For more detailed information on the various options, see: :doc:`Users (tenant) </admin-settings/tenant-settings/user-management/users/index>`
