Groups - business profile
=============================================

**This option is available in Omnia 7.5. Work on the page is ongoing.**

This list displays groups for User management for the business profile. You can create, edit and delete groups here:

The options here works the same way as in User management for the tenant. There are only two major differences:

+ Groups set up in a business profile is valid for that business profile only.
+ The filter "Owner", available in the tenant list, is not available for a business profile.

For more detailed information on the various options, see: :doc:`Groups (tenant) </admin-settings/tenant-settings/user-management/groups/index>`
