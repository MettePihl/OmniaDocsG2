**This page is being updated. Will be finsihed soon**

Within a Business Profile several Publishing Apps can be active for different settings. To be able to create a Publishing App, at least one template for Publishing Apps must be available. If none are, create a template first.

Here you will see a list of Publishing Apps in the Business Profile, for example:

Available settings depends on how the template is set up. Here are some common examples:

Here you can select an image to be shown there, using the Media Picker. When an image has been selected it can be deleted or edited using the X and the pen that is shown then.
+ **Show in Public Listings**: If a link to the app should be available in public listings (meaning listings in Omnia) select this option. If this option is deselected, the app can only be reached by specific links, for example in a Workspace navigation.

+ **Alias**: The last part of the address to the site is created automatically but can be edited if necessary. If the name (address) already exists an alternative address is suggested.
