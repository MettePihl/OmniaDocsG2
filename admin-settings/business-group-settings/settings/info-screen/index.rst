Info Screen
===============

You can use this option to display information from Omnia on a screen, for example in a common space for staff or in a lobby. 

It can be one or more pages in Omnia or a rollup of some kind, where a rollup of news is one example. As an alternative, you can select a video to be shown on the screen.

**Note!** In Omnia 7.0 and later, Info Screen is replaced by Digital Signage, but the Info Screen functionality is still available for backwards compatibility. For a new implementation, use Digital Signage.
