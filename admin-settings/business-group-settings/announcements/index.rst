Announcements
===========================================

Here an administrator for this business profile (or any other users added to the separate permissions list) can create announcements that will be displayed in the specific business profile only. 

The permissions settings for working with announcements, are found under the general permissions option for the business profile: :doc:`Permissions for a business profile </admin-settings/business-group-settings/permissions/index>`

Business profile announcements can also be displayed through the Announcements block. For more information about the block, see: :doc:`The Announcements block </blocks/announcements/index>`

The options for creating and editing announcements are identical to the options for tenant announcements, see this page for more information on how to create and edit announcements: :doc:`Tenant announcements </admin-settings/tenant-settings/announcements/index>`
