Announcements
===========================================

Here an administrator for this Business Profile (or any other users added to the separate Permissions list) can create Announcements that will be displayed in the specific Business Profile only. 

**Note!** In Omnia 6.12 and later, the permissions settings for working with announcements, are found under the general Permissions option for the Business Profile: :doc:`Permissions for a Business Profile </admin-settings/business-group-settings/permissions/index>`

Business Profile Announcements can also be displayed through the Announcements block. For more information about the block, see: :doc:`The Announcements block </blocks/announcements/index>`

The options for creating and editing Announcements are identical to the options for Tenant Announcements, see this page for more information on how to create and edit Announcements: :doc:`Tenant Announcements </admin-settings/tenant-settings/announcements/index>`
