Shared links
===========================================

Using shared links a business profile administrator (or any other users added to the separate permissions list) can create business profile specific links that users can access through "My links".  

Some links can be mandatory and it's also possible to target links to certain colleagues or groups. 

These links can also be accessed through a Quick links block on any page, see: :doc:`The Quick links block </blocks/quick-links/index>`

A list of shared links for the business profile can look like this:

Options for tenant shared links and business profile shared links are identical. For information on how to create and edit shared links, see: :doc:`Shared links (Tenant) </admin-settings/tenant-settings/shared-links/index>`

Permissions
*************
Permissions settings for working with shared links are found here: :doc:`Permissions for a business profile </admin-settings/business-group-settings/permissions/index>`

Note that business profile administrators always can work with shared links.
