Dashboard
===========

Here you can build the Admin Dashboard to your needs, to display dashboard information on many different aspects of the tenant. You set up the Dashboard the same as you would any layout in Omnia. Most sections and blocks can be used.

The Metrics block can be especially useful: :doc:`The Metrics block </blocks/metrics-block-612/index>`

You can also edit some of the metrics settings, in Omnia Admin, see: :doc:`Metric settings </admin-settings/tenant-settings/settings/metrics/index>`
