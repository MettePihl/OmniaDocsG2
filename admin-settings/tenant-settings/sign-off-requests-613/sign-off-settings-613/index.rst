Here you can set the maximum number of e-mails to be sent from a Sign-off request:

.. image:: sign-off-requests-settings-settings-new.png

This setting will be used when requests are sent to a group that is not e-mail enabled. The administrator sending the request may be alerted to add e-mail addresses.

If requests are sent to a group that is e-mail enabled, there is nothing to consider and this setting is ignored.
