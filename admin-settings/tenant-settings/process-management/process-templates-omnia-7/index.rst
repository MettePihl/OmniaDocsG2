Process Templates in Omnia 7.0
=============================================

**This is an upcoming Omnia 7.0 option. Work on this documentation has just started**.

If any templates has been created, they are listed here, for example:

.. image:: process-templates-7-1.png

To edit a template, click the name. To create a new template, click the plus.

Create a new Process Template
********************************
When you create a new template, the first step is to add a name:

.. image:: process-templates-7-new1.png

Then click the name of the new process to start working with the layout:

.. image:: process-templates-7-new2.png

The layout work area is shown:

.. image:: process-templates-7-new3.png

This is done in a very similar way to working with the layout for Workspace, see the heading "Working with the layout" on this page: :doc:`Navigation bar </admin-settings/business-group-settings/workplace/navigation-bar/index>`

There are a few differences, which will be documented soon. Also note that all process steps can have a different layout, if needed.
