In this example Can(Grey) and Pentagon (Regular) are added. That's why they can be edited.

Note that when you add a shape to a Process Template, there's a number of settings you can do for the shape, see the heading "Settings for a shape" on this page: :doc:`The Drawing tab - authoring processes </working-with-processes/authoring-processes/working-with-drafts/drawing-tab/index>`

Edit or remove a shape
************************
A shape you have added can be edited or removed (the default shapes can not). Click the pen to edit or the dust bin to remove.
