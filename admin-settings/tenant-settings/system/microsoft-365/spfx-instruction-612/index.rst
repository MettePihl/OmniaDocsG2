**Important note!** If running the tenant in monitoring mode, Omnia will not work inside SPFx as most options in SharePoint will not work.

**Also note!**: Monitoring mode is SharePoint online functionality. There's a lot of information available on Microsoft pages regarding how this works. Search for "SharePoint monitoring mode".
