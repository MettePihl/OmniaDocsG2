Dynamic Groups
=============================================

This option is available in Omnia 7.0 and later.

**Work on the documentation is ongoing.**

Here dynamic groups can be created, edited and deleted. Dynamic security groups are based on user types, not on membership. They will replace and expand on the built-in groups “Internal users” and “External users” and can be used to protect information.

The user types are those created in User Management, using the User Types option, see: :doc:`User Types </admin-settings/tenant-settings/user-management/user-types/index>`
