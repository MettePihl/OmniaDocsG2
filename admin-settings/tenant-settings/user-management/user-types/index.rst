User Types
=============================================

This option is available in Omnia 7.0 and later.

All users in Omnia will be assigned a user type. User types are also used when creating Omnia only users and when setting up dynamic groups. It's also possible to create customized user profile cards for different user types.

If any user types has been set up so far, they are listed here, for example:

.. image:: user-management-types.png

Use the dust bin to delete a user type, the pen to edit and the third icon to create a customized user profile card, if needed.

These settings can be used when creating a new user type:

Create a custom user profile card
************************************
Creating a custom user profile card works somewhat similar to working with the layout for Workspace, see the heading "Working with the layout" on this page: :doc:`Navigation bar </admin-settings/business-group-settings/workplace/navigation-bar/index>`

There are a some differences, which will be documented soon.
