User types
=============================================

This option is available in Omnia 7.0 and later.

All users in Omnia will be assigned a user type. User types are also used when creating Omnia users and when setting up dynamic groups. It's also possible to create customized user profile cards for different user types.

**Important note!** In Omnia 7.5 authentication settings are set per user type. See below for more information.

If any user types for Omnia users has been set up so far, they are listed here, for example:

.. image:: user-management-types-new.png

Use the dust bin to delete a user type, the pen to edit and the third icon to create a customized user profile card, if needed.

These settings can be used when creating a new user type:

.. image:: user-management-types-settings-new.png

As you can see, the name and description can be added in any tenant language. 

Additions in Omnia 7.5
*************************
In Omnia 7.5 you can also set authentication method and add properties to a user type:

.. image:: user-management-types-auth.png

On the Properties tab, something like the following is available:

.. image:: user-management-types-prop.png

Here you decide which properties should be available for this user type. A few properties are mandatory and can not be deselected, they are marked with gray.

Create a custom user profile card
************************************
You can create a custom user profile card for each user group if needed, and you create different layouts for private cards and public cards. A private custom user profile card is simply when a user looks at his or her own card, a public card is what everyone else can see.

You work with the layout for the cards the same way as other layouts in Omnia, see: :doc:`Working with layouts </general-assets/working-with-layouts/index>`

Of course, just a few of the available blocks makes sense to use here, but that is up to you.

Here's an example of a user profile card layout (shown in edit mode):

.. image:: user-card-layout.png

At the top, a User information block is added. Next, a Tab section is added, for navigation purposes, for three tabs with information. The first tab is a Properties block (Contact), the second is an Organization tree block, and the third (Experience) is a Properties block.

For more information about the blocks, see: 

+ :doc:`The User information block </blocks/user-information-block/index>`
+ :doc:`The Properties block </blocks/properties-block/index>`
+ :doc:`The Organization tree block </blocks/organization-tree/index>`

As an addtion in Omnia 7.5 you can now preview the card alyout for different users:
