User types
=============================================

This option is available in Omnia 7.0 and later.

All users in Omnia will be assigned a user type. User types are also used when creating Omnia users and when setting up dynamic groups. It's also possible to create customized user profile cards for different user types.

If any user types has been set up so far, they are listed here, for example:

.. image:: user-management-types-new.png

Use the dust bin to delete a user type, the pen to edit and the third icon to create a customized user profile card, if needed.

These settings can be used when creating a new user type:

As you can see, the name and description can be added in any tenant language. 

Create a custom user profile card
************************************
You work with the layout for customer profile cards the same way as other layouts in Omnia, see: :doc:`Working with layouts </general-assets/working-with-layouts/index>`

Of course, just a few of the available blocks makes sense to use here, but that is up to you.

Here's an example of a user profile card layout (shown in edit mode):

.. image:: user-card-layout.png

At the top, a User Information block is added. Next, a Tab section is added, for navigation purposes, for three tabs with information. The first tab is a Properties block (Contact), the second is an Organization Tree block, and the third (Experience) is a Properties block.

For more information about the blocks, see:
