Authentication
=============================================

This option is available in Omnia 7.0 and later.

Omnia supports any custom authentication provider to be plugged into the system. Built-in authentication providers are Azure AD, Active Directory (for Omnia on-prem) and Omnia. Omnia provides support for a range of authentication options, including passwords, one-time passwords (OTPs), magic links, and combinations of these methods.

A "Magic link" is simply a one time link.
