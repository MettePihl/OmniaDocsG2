Login log
=============================================

Use this list, available in Omnia 7.5 and later, to keep track of logins and login attempts, for example useful if you suspect hacking attempts.

The list for the log can look like this (image from a test environment):

You can filter the list on Date - the last 7 days or the last 24 ours. You can browse or search for a specific user and filter on Status - successful or failed login.
