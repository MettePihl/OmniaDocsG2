+ **Archived**: A list of Controlled Documents archives in this tenant. You can click a link to go to the archive and find out more, if you have the permission to access the archive. Each archive is a separate site and has it's own permissions.
+ **Passed review date**: This is the same list as "Expired Reviews".
+ **Sent for comments**: A list of sites with active Sent for Comments workflows. The list displays the number of active workflows per site.
