Permanently delete document
====================================

(This option was called Document Termination in earlier Omnia versions).

If your organization uses retention of documents, the retention manager receives a notification by e-mail when a document has expired, with a link to this list. The retention manager can then decide if a document should be terminated or kept.

When a controlled document is terminated, all files that belong to the document are deleted and can not be restored.

**Note!** A retention manager must have been set up in the system for this to work, see: :doc:`Document Management Settings </admin-settings/tenant-settings/document-management/settings/index>`
