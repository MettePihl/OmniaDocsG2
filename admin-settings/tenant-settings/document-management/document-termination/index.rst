Document Termination
=======================

If your organization uses Retention of Documents, the Retention Manager receives a notification by e-mail when a document has expired, with a link to this list. The Retention Manager can then decide if a document should be terminated or kept.

When a document is terminated, all files that belong to the controlled document are deleted and can not be restored.

**Note!** A Retention Manager must have been set up in the system for this to work, see: :doc:`Document Management Settings </admin-settings/tenant-settings/document-management/settings/index>`

**Also Note**: In Omnia 7.0 and later, this option is renamed "Permanently delete document". The functionality is the same.
