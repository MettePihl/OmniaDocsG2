Layouts (Digital Signage)
=============================================

**Work on this page has just started. Will be finished soon.**

Here you create layouts to be used for digital signage. You do that the same way as as when creating layouts to, for example, publishing pages. More details will be added here soon, but in the meantime, check this page: :doc:`Publishing Layouts </admin-settings/business-group-settings/publishing-apps/publishing-65/layout/index>`
