Layouts (Digital Signage)
=============================================

**Work on this page has just started. Will be finished soon.**

Here you create layouts to be used for digital signage. You do that the same way in a similar way to when creating layouts to, for example, publishing pages. More details will be added here soon, but in the meantime, check this page: :doc:`Publishing Layouts </admin-settings/business-group-settings/publishing-apps/publishing-65/layout/index>`

You can use these layouts when you create screens for a web browser.
