Requests
==========

All created requests are listed here. You can filter on "Requested By" and "Progress Status" (In Progress or Completed).

Here's an example of a list:

To add or remove pages
----------------------------
Here's how to add or remove pages for a Sign-off Request. It works the same with a template or without.

If you use a template, this list will be pre populated, for example:

To remove a page from the list, click the dust bin (this does not affect the template). To add additional pages, click the plus.

The following is shown:

You can now Navigate and Pick (Browse) or Search, the same way as in the Page Picker (it's a part of the Page Picker that is used here). See this page for more information: :doc:`The Page Picker </general-assets/page-picker/index>`

Here you click ADD when you have selected one or more pages to add to the Sign-off Request.
