Enterprise glossary
====================

Enterprise glossary can be used for taxonomies/terms, to edit look and feel and/or to connect the term to a page for more information. Terms can even be created specifically to provide more information where it's needed. 

Also, if you plan to use the block "Taxonomy navigation" you need to set up the taxonomies to be used for navigation here.

Here's an example of a people rollup displaying three properties:

.. image:: glossary-example.png

The location and organization properties can be clicked for more information, indicated by the icon to the right of the property name. Here's what such information can look like:

.. image:: glossary-example-info.png

In this example, there's a READ MORE link that can be used to go to the IT Helpdesk organization page.

Settings
****************
The existing glossary sets are listed here (for example):

+ Edit settings for the information page (if used).
+ Delete the glossary set.

----------------------------
To create a new glossary set, do the following:

If you don't want to connect the glossary set to an information page - for example if you just want to edit look and feel - you're done now.

**Note!** For a glossary set that will be used for taxonomy navigation, all mappings should be to pages.

To connect to an information page, do the following:

1. Select "Page" for Details provider.

2. Set the settings needed.

+ **Show Read more**: This is a link to the information page. If you just want to show the summary and/or description from the page as information, deselect this option.
+ **Image**: Select the property to use for the image.
+ **Image ratio**: Select image ratio to be shown in the information dialog.
+ **Name**: Select the property for the page name to be shown in the information dialog (often Title).
+ **Summary**: There's two possible content fields in the information dialog. You can show one or both. Here you can decide to show the page summary, by selecting the property that holds that kind of information.
+ **Description**: You can also choose to show text from a description field, that usually holds more information. If you don't want to use a Read more link, you may want to show more information than just the summary. If you want to show a description, select the property here.
+ **Person**: Select property for the name to be shown in the information dialog (see below).
