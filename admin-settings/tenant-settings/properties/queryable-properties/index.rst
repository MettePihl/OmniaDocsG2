Queryable Properties
===========================

Here, you add Properties that should be queryable in Omnias database. The Properties are used in the Query Builder, so far in these blocks:

+ **App Instances**: In Teamwork Rollup.
+ **Pages**: In Page Rollup.
+ **Processes**: In Process Rollup.
+ **Sign-off Request**: In Sign-off Requests Rollup.

To be available here, a property must first be added to Enterprise Properties. 

These lists are available here:
