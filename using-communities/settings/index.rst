Setting up a community
========================

Setting up a community is pretty straight forward. You need to be either Tenant Administrator or Business Profile Administrator for the business profile where the community should be available.

You also need to have page editor permissions to a suitable page to set upp access to the community.

Creating a community
**********************
Do the following to create a community:

1. Go to Omnia Admin.
2. Open "Communities" in the Business Profile settings.

3. Create at least one template, as describe here: :doc:`Templates for Communities </admin-settings/business-group-settings/communities/communities-65/templates/index>`. 
4. Create a Community Site according to the description on this page: :doc:`Communities Apps </admin-settings/business-group-settings/communities/communities-65/apps/index>`
5. When the site has been created, you can use the link (Title) in Communities to go to the site. (To get the Url, you can also right click on the Title and copy the link address).
6. Setup access to the community some way, using the Url. (More information about that below.)

Setting up access to communities
**********************************
You set up access using the options available in Omnia. Here's an example using banners for access to the various communities available:

(MY SUBSCRIPTIONS is an action button in this example.)

This is just an example for inspiration. Access to communities can be set up many other ways in Omnia.

Settings for the Community
*****************************
After the community has been created there are some settings you may want to do.
