Edit a knowledge article
==========================

A community can be set up in sevaral ways but in the default setup any colleague can edit a published Knowledge article. All colleagues have author permissions for the knowledge pages in the tenant.

This is how it's done:

1. Open the knowledge article.
2. Open the editor and select "Write".
