My links
===========================================

Using My links a user can access sites, documents and more, that has been setup in Omnia admin.

All mandatory links, decided by the administrator when adding the links in Omnia admin, are always shown.

Links can also be targeted to certain user groups, and only shown to them. A search field can be shown, which can be used to search for links. 

Options that can be available:

+ **Show all links**: When this option is selected all links, that the user is allowed to see, are shown. A user can select to show non mandatory links, or not. See below.
+ **Show categories**: Links can be categorized. If this option is selected categories (headings) are shown and the links are sorted byt the categories. See below for more information.
+ **Add personal link**: A user can add personal links as well, using this option. See below for an instruction.

In the above image "Business Application", "Our Products" and "Portal" are categories. Here's the same My links list without categories:

The administrator setting up the link can add additional information about a link (and additional information can be added to personal links as well). In that case an i-icon is shown for the link. To read the information, point at the i-icon.
