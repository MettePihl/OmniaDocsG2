My Subscriptions
==================

You can subscribe to a community, articles and discussions in a community, to tags and to channels.

This page describes how this works in Omnia 6.12 and earlier. For Omnia 6.13 and later, see: :doc:`My Subscriptions in Omnia 6.13 </user-options/my-subscriptions-613/index>`

For information about subscriptions regarding communities, see: :doc:`Subscriptions in Communities </using-communities/subscriptions/index>`

For information about how to subscribe and unsubscribe to channels, see below.

Use My subscriptions for an overview of your subscriptions. You can unsubscribe using this as well.

My descriptions can be available in more than one way, for example under "My Profile":

My Subscriptions can also be available in a block on any page.

Here's an example:

.. image:: my-subscriptions-1-new.png

The left tab (shown in the image above) lists all communities you subscribe to - meaning you subscribe to ALL activities in that community. 

The second tab lists all knowledge articles and discussion you subscribe to, for example:

.. image:: my-subscriptions-2-new.png

You can click the title to go to the page or discussion.

The third tab displays a list of all tags you subscribe to, for example:

.. image:: my-subscriptions-3-new.png

You can unsubscribe to any subscription by clicking the dust bin.
