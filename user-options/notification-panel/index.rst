Notification panel
===========================================

A noticification panel can be present in the action panel or on any page. The purpose is to help users find out what information has been updated within different areas of the intranet.

Several different notification panels can be created for different purposes, where one of them can be displayed in the action menu. Others can be displayed through a block, on any page.

A number - 3 in the example below - indicates the number of new messages for the user:

Here's an example of what can be found in a notification panel:

What a notification panel will display depends on settings in Omnia admin. The following is an example, described from left to right:

+ **News**: (See image above). Latest News from the news archive, with the very latest at the top. Click to read the full news article. 
+ **Team news**: Latest news from the team sites the user is a member of. Messages are grouped by team site, for example:

.. image:: team-site-news-new2.png

To see the messages from a team site, click it. The latest messages from that team site are then shown, the very latest at the top. It can look like this:

Click the heading of a message to go the team site to read the full message. The author's name is also clickable here and will take you the author's user profile card, if it's used within your organization. If it's not, the author's delve page will be displayed.

+ **Tasks**: When tasks are assigned to the user in a team site, a notification will show up here. The tasks are grouped by team site: Here's an example with the list opened for one of the sites:

To go to the team site to see all tasks, click "View all tasks".

+ **Documents**: This lists all documents in team sites the user is a member of, that are new or has been updated recently, the newest at the top. Here's an example:
