+ **Paging**: You can choose between no paging and classic paging.
+ **Default Sort Order**: Select the column for default sort order for the list.
+ **Sort Direction**: Select Descending or Ascending for the default ordering field here.
+ **Column**: Use this option to add a column to be shown. Open the list, select the column and click "ADD".
+ **Display columns in published view**: Here you selected how the columns are listed. To remove a column click the dust bin. If no dust bin is shown for a column it's mandatory, and therefore can't be removed. You can set the order of the columns by grabbing the Equal To icon for the column and drag it to another place in the list.

You can also remove some of the columns by clicking the dust bin for that column and you can arrange the order of the columns (left to right). To do that, grab the far right icon for the column and use drag and drop.
