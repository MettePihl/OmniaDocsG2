Displaying processes for users
=================================

When considering how to display processes for end users, you can use one of these approaches, or a combination of them:

+ Add a page and place a process rollup to list available processes.
+ Add a separate page for every process and use a suitable page type.

Using a process rollup
*************************
If you use a process rollup you don't have to create separate pages for the processes. When a user clicks a process in the process rollup, a system page is then used to display the process.

Here's an excample of a page with a process rollup:

For more information on how to set up a process rollup, see: :doc:`Process management </blocks/process-blocks/process-rollup/index>`

Creating a page to display a process
**************************************
If you decide to add a separate page for each process you should create a page type for that use. 

.. image:: process-image-type.png

When creating such a page, you HAVE to set the process to be displayed. You do that on the Properties tab of the page.

Here's an example of a process displayed with a Process Page Type:

Other than selecting a process as the property, you work with the page the same way as any other page.
