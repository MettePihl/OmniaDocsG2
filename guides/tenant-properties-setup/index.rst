Here we can see user properties such as First name, Last name, Name, Work phone ; And their values right next to them. 

In order to access this view, follow these steps:
   
- Visit the sharepoint admin center by typing in https://(insert the name of your tenant)-admin.sharepoint.com 
- Click on user profiles in the left menu
- Click on Manager user profiles
- Type in the name of the user you wish to inspect

In order for a user profile property to be used in omnia, it has to be mapped first, and in order for it to be mapped, we need to know the name of the property, which can be found in search:

we then go in to Manage search Schema:
